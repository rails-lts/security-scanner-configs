  # PLEASE CHECK Merged upstream bug fix for Psych >= 2.0 (which requires Ruby >= 1.9) for possible RCE escalation bug with Serialized Columns in Active Record. We tried to make it less of a breaking change than the official patch by adding a default set of permitted serializable classes. Note this patch has no effect for Rubies < 2.1, see https://makandracards.com/railslts/521762-change-to-activerecord-deserialization-cve-2022-32224 for more details.
